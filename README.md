# UB-Document-Project.

This is a community project to distribute the findings of the UB History project documents chest.

The Upper Borughton history group recently embarked on translating, photographing and cataloging the contents of a large metal document chest mainly containing legal papers from the 1600’s onwards. The chest had been stored in a garage for many years and the documents were in near perfect condition.

Since the inception of the project there has been quite a lot of interest including news items on local BBC and radio interviews from NZ radio.

It’s hoped that by presenting the information, linking the images of the documents, translations (sometimes from the Latin) and compiling into table format these documents should become an open and free resource for anyone wishing to research their family history in the Melton Mowbray / South Notts area.
